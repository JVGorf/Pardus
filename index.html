<span style="color: #5e9ca0;">18. CSS edits.</span></h3>

<h4><span style="color: #5e9ca0;">[2,3]</span> Default visuals on the Nav screen are set to display at 64px. This is still true but I'm using the 128px buildings, planets, ships, and mobs which get compressed to fit into a 64px area for better looking models.<br /><br />

<span style="color: #5e9ca0;">[10]</span> Ideally, the app should be edited rather than Pardus but it's not my place to do that.<br /><br />

<span style="color: #5e9ca0;">[12]</span> This is rendered in most cases. The rest, whether intentionally or mistakenly, pull images from a static source. Even though this is limited to a handful of pages, the visuals are vastly improved. I redid the 16px faction icons for the sake of the mission completion board - this is basically pixel art now but looks better.<br /><br />

<span style="color: #5e9ca0;">[13]</span> New stylized Pardus race icons no longer have that wax look. As usual, I'm using new 128px images contained at 64px. So it looks much better but with one sacrifice; the player gossip images when landed. The 128px images do not contain within the 52px divs so you only see a portion of the image. I'm not sure what happened here - they should have been set to 64px anyway. The divs are in-line with no ID so I'm not able to fix this with CSS. This combined with the fact that some race icons are pulled from a static source means a messy edit. I think Pardus developers <i>intended</i> for a full image pack replacement but for whatever reasons, once again, the static images are interfering with consistency.<br /><br />

<span style="color: #5e9ca0;">[15]</span> After improving the mission icons, the mission log, as well as other logs appear worse in contrast. The problem here is that I cannot contain larger images so I'm stuck with 16x16 px icons. Back in 2005, 1024x768 was the leading monitor size with 1366x768 gradually becoming more prevalent. In 2025, screen resolutions are higher giving these old icons a dated and blurry look. To fix this, I'm basically doing pixel art with fewer colors and harder edges.<br /><br />

<span style="color: #5e9ca0;">[16]</span> By default NPC SB's (NSB) appear slightly more vibrant than PSB's. I have reversed this. However, the difference is subtle so I've added tower lights to PSB's to help them stand out more. Neutral PSB's looked too much like Empire PSB's so I've changed neutral PSB's to look like their Neutral NSB counterparts, except that Nuetral PSB's also contain tower lights... don't blame me for your electric bill. TLDR: Your player Star Base looks a bit prettier now.<br /><br />
