<h4><span style="color: #5e9ca0;">[1]</span> Default visuals on the Nav screen are set to display at 64px. This is still true but I'm using the 128px buildings, planets, ships, and mobs which get compressed to fit into a 64px area for better looking models.<br /><br />

<span style="color: #5e9ca0;">[2]</span> Ideally, the app should be edited rather than Pardus but it's not my place to do that.<br /><br />

<span style="color: #5e9ca0;">[3]</span> This is rendered in most cases. The rest, whether intentionally or mistakenly, pull images from a static source. Even though this is limited to a handful of pages, the visuals are vastly improved. However, one sacrifice must be made - the crispy version faction icons appear overly large on the mission completion log. If anyone has a CSS fix for this and you care to share, then let me know.<br /><br />

<span style="color: #5e9ca0;">[4]</span> New stylized Pardus race icons no longer have that wax look. Like other images, these are now 128px but fit in their 64px box for better "pop". Unfortunately, like so many other icons, some race icons are pulled from a static source so in some cases you will still see the old icons. E.G. profile pages.<br /><br />
